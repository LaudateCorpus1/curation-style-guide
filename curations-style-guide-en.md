The goal of Moments is to showcase the very best of what's happening on
Twitter --- the amazing conversations and memes, the breaking news and
the diverse voices and perspectives.

Moments are intended to feature compelling, original and diverse
content. When selecting Tweets for a Moment, we consider the content of
the Tweet, any media, and the avatar and username of the poster.

-   **Impartiality**: We will use data-driven decision making when choosing
    Tweets around controversial topics, and highlight the Tweets already
    receiving the most engagement on Twitter. On topics which reflect public
    debate, we will select Tweets that represent many sides of the
    conversation, where feasible. Twitter curators should not advance their own
    viewpoints, but rather reflect the discussion as it appears on our
    platform.

-   **Accuracy:** When dealing with news or newsworthy conversations, we want
    to highlight quality Tweets that represent accurate information.

-   **Corrections:** If we become aware that we have highlighted content that
    turns out to be inaccurate, we will update the Moment with a visible
    correction, and issue an updated Tweet. In rare cases, we may delete the
    Moment and post a retraction.

-   **Standards**: Profanity, violence, nudity, and other types of potentially
    sensitive content should be avoided, except where it is necessary to tell a
    newsworthy story. We will not include content that promotes or depicts
    illegal conduct. We will provide individuals with clear notice that a
    Moment may contain potentially sensitive content.

    This style guide is designed to complement the existing [curation
    policies](https://about.twitter.com/company/moments-guidelines) that help
    our curation team create engaging, factual, and impartial content that can
    resonate globally. It is meant to be a guide only: We may change the guide
    or deviate from it, from time to time.

#### The Golden Rule

**We speak in the language of Twitter.**

For example, when we're adding emoji to the end of our sentences or
questioning whether percent is one word or two, we strive to stay true
to the conversation on the platform.

#### Ad hominem

Ad hominem attacks criticize a person, rather than their idea or
position in an argument.

It's the difference between choosing a commentary Tweet that says, "The
prime minister is an unhelpful person," and "The prime minister's
statement was unhelpful."

We avoid including Tweets attacking an individual or their character
unless they are integral to the conversation as it is occurring on
Twitter and can be placed appropriately in context.

#### Abbreviations

When shortening country and organization names, we do not use periods.
This reflects the common usage on Twitter. So it's US and UK, not U.S.
and U.K.

#### Active shooter reports

The [Department of Homeland Security defines](https://www.dhs.gov/xlibrary/assets/active_shooter_booklet.pdf)
an active shooter as "an individual actively engaged in killing or
attempting to kill people in a confined and populated area; in most
cases, active shooters use firearms(s) and there is no pattern or method
to their selection of victims." It notes that these incidents are
unpredictable, evolve quickly and are normally over in 10 to 15
minutes~~.~~ ([The DHS pamphlet is also available in Spanish](https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/active-shooter-pamphlet-spanish-508.pdf)).

This term is often used incorrectly in breaking news situations, most
often to describe reports of shots fired. Misusing the term active
shooter,
[Factal](https://blog.factal.com/2019/03/not-an-active-shooter-how-abusing-the-term-fuels-more-fear/)
says, "needlessly legitimizes and escalates a situation," including
increasing calls to police and fuelling panic among those nearby and
concerned who are following along.

We should avoid using the term "active shooter" unless police confirm an
active incident. Instead, such reports should be described as "possible
shootings" or "police responding to reports of a gunman."

#### Annotations

Annotations provide context, background, biographical notes,
translations, or subheadings to Moments. They can also be used to
explain the choice of Tweets, for example, by explaining someone's
expertise.

Anything written in an annotation should be easily verifiable or
attributable. For example, by including the original-language Tweet
alongside a translation in an annotation.\
\
We do not want annotations to repurpose or repackage other people's
content; we always prefer to use Tweets. When using information that is
not available in Tweets, paraphrase or quote as necessary, but try to
keep it short.

Annotations used as headings should follow the same style as titles,
while annotation body text should be written in sentences.

#### Attribution

Everything stated in a Moment title, description, and Tweet should also
appear within the Moment.

When a fact is supported by three or fewer sources, we attribute to the
source, by name, in the title, or description. Once it has been
confirmed by more than three sources, the "reports" and attribution
references may be removed. ~~\
~~

Instead of using "reportedly," "according to sources" or "it is believed
to be" in our Moments, it is preferable to attribute the information to
the source.

#### Bodily functions

We should not curate just to gross people out. Accordingly, we shouldn't
create Moments just focused on bodily functions, especially when it
isn't being widely discussed.

If we do make a Moment like this, please consider the context in
choosing our words and tone, and do not ~~to~~ feature the gross content
in the cover image.

#### Brands

We avoid including content from brand accounts in Moments unless we
think it's integral to the conversation.

#### Clickbait

Curation helps give people the context and narrative they need to
understand the things that matter on Twitter. So we want to make sure
that our titles and descriptions give people the context they need to
decide if they want more information.

We still want our titles to be conversational, informative and creative,
without veering into clickbait. Clickbait intentionally withholds
information to mislead people, or poses questions that force them to
click.

#### Collective nouns

Names of businesses, political parties, and groups are singular and we
treat them as such, i.e. Company X released its earnings Wednesday.

Bands and teams are treated differently between markets, so our style is
to write around the singular/plural discrepancies. For example, instead
of writing *The band released its/their new album* choose *The new album
is here*. When it's difficult to write around it, we default to the way
people on Twitter typically speak (i.e., The band (with a plural name)
are dropping a Canadian tour).

#### Crime

When covering conversations about crime, we should refrain from putting
photos of the suspect or accused on the cover, particularly when the
only photos available are candids, rather than police sketches or court
appearances.

We should avoid using the names and images of alleged attackers
prominently in our titles, descriptions and covers. Our Moments should
prioritize those affected by the event.

#### Curating about misinformation

Our mission is to provide quality content and context to help people
judge the accuracy of the information that they're seeing.

Misinformation comes in many forms, including, [according to UNESCO](http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0026/002655/265552E.pdf):

-   Satire and parody: no intent to cause harm but potential to fool

-   False connection: titles, images and/or captions don\'t support the
    > content

-   Misleading content: misleading use of information to frame an issue
    > or individual

-   False context: when genuine content is re-shared with wrong
    > information about the situation

-   Imposter content: impersonating genuine sources

-   Manipulated content: altering true content in a way that deceives

-   Fabricated content: falsehoods

Before curating conversations about misinformation, we need to consider
how visible it is on the platform and the communities that are sharing
it. We want to avoid moving a niche topic into the mainstream
conversation. Therefore, we should prioritize providing accurate
information around something that is in a country's top trends rather
than seeking out conversations with limited reach.

When curating on these topics, we must provide multiple sources for
verification and offer very clear attribution.

Do not repeat the false claim in the title and description. As [First Draft
explains](https://medium.com/1st-draft/5-lessons-for-reporting-in-an-age-of-disinformation-9d98f0441722),
"It doesn't matter if the 850 word article provides all the context and
explanation to debunk or explain why a narrative or claim is false, if the 80
character version of that context is misleading, it's all for nothing."

Be cautious of repeating unfamiliar phrases used in the misinformation,
as these keywords may be strategically created to drive people to
discover more misinformation. You can learn more about that phenomenon, with
the example of "crisis actors," from [the Data & Society Research Institute](https://points.datasociety.net/media-manipulation-strategic-amplification-and-responsible-journalism-95f4d611f462).

#### Dates

We should not use the terms *yesterday*, *today,* or *tomorrow* in
titles or descriptions because it may be Thursday in the United States,
but it's already Friday in Australia. Or a late-night game on Tuesday
night could still be featured on Wednesday morning. Use the day of the
week instead.

For live events, include relevant time zones, for example: Tune in live
from 2pm AEST, 12am ET and 4am GMT. If there isn't enough space, default
to the time zone of the country of origin.

When writing a date, please style it as the month (not abbreviated) and
the day. Example: May 12, September 12.

Please style decades as the numeral followed by an "s," such as the 60s,
70s, 80s or 90s.

#### Developing news

In breaking and developing news situations, we should be clear about the
degree to which information has been confirmed, along with the sources
of that information (see [Attribution](#attribution)). We
do not need to include "more to come," or "stay here for updates" in our
descriptions, but we should update the title and description as the
situation develops.

#### Disabilities and illnesses

We avoid language that appears to define people by their condition or
illness. For example, use "people with disabilities," rather than
"disabled people," or "the disabled."

Additionally, mention disabilities, or a disease, only if they are
relevant to the conversation. We should avoid descriptions that make a
disease or disability seem like an affliction, such as "suffers from
Parkinson's disease," or "battling cancer," opting instead for "has
Parkinson's disease," or "has cancer." We may use mental illness as a
general term, but we prefer to use specific conditions when possible.

Please refer to people the way they self-identify. For example, some people
with hearing impairments identify as Deaf, which encompasses identity and
culture, instead of deaf, which means someone with limited hearing. ([Read more
about that distinction
here](https://www.verywell.com/deaf-culture-big-d-small-d-1046233)).

For more, please visit the [National Center on Disability and Journalism's
style guide](http://ncdj.org/style-guide/), which has an alphabetized list of
terms and considerations.

#### Disputed claims

Our role is to help people see as much context as possible around
information gaining popularity on Twitter. If popular, high-profile
conversations include information that is factually disputed by a wide
number of sources, we should clearly cite those sources in the context
that we provide. To every extent possible, we should avoid repeating
disputed information in the title.

#### Emoji

We use emoji as emphasis or to replace emotion in our titles and
descriptions, not to replace words. Keep emoji at the end of titles and
sentences, as a lot of people on Twitter do. We should not use emoji for
serious or potentially sensitive topics, or for breaking news.

#### Esports

We consider esports (lowercase e, except when styled differently in an
event's proper name) a catchall term for competitive multiplayer video
gaming. Competition normally occurs in leagues, or tournaments, where
commentators are typically called casters. The two main variants of
esports are first-person shooters (note the hyphen), also known as FPS,
and MOBAs, which stands for Multiplayer Online Battle Arena. We should
define both acronyms when referenced in our Moments. Simulations of
conventional sports, including FIFA and Madden, are also popular
variants, while the largest tournament is Evo, focusing on a range of
fighting games.

We give video game titles take the same treatment as [movie and book titles](#books-films-shows-and-albums), with title case but
no italics or quotation marks.

#### Gendered terms

When possible, our preference is to use the non-gendered term to
describe a person's job or role. For example, police officer instead of
policeman.

For celebrities, when a preference isn't stated, we default to "actor"
or "singer" for both genders. To quote Whoopi Goldberg: "An actress can
only play a woman. I'm an actor -- I can play anything."

#### Hashtags

We should not include hashtags in Moment titles, as they're not
clickable for readers.

Words within hashtags may be capped, to improve readability within a
description or Tweet (i.e. \#StarWarsDay vs \#starwarsday).

#### Health and science studies

In our view, a good health or science Moment:

-   Presents the entire story.

-   Provides the necessary context to understand the research.

-   Doesn't overstate the study results.

We start by looking at the study itself:

-   Where is it published?

-   Is it peer-reviewed? (That means other experts in the field have
    > evaluated the methods and results).

-   What was the sample size?

-   Read the study abstract and analyze what the researchers are saying.
    > Are the news headlines exaggerating or overstating the claims?

We look for experts in the field who are fact-checking or responding to
the study. We hope that by presenting alternative viewpoints, from
experts, we help our readers draw their own conclusions.

#### Homelessness

We aim to use [people-first language](https://www.usich.gov/news/people-experience-homelessness-they-arent-defined-by-it/)
in our curation to avoid labelling or inviting judgement on people based
on their situation. In lieu of calling people homeless, we should use
"people experiencing homelessness."

#### Identity 

When describing people and groups, we defer to the way they
self-identify. We avoid generalizing or guessing people's identities,
including around gender, ethnicity, political affiliations, or
faith-based beliefs.

We should only mention an individual's race or ethnicity when a
conversation is definitively about that topic, for example in historic,
groundbreaking events or certain social justice coverage.

When it comes to an individual's or group's positions and beliefs, we
should show, rather than tell. Instead of applying a political or
ideological label, we should try to describe the specific position or
behaviour of the person or organization in order to provide the context
that is relevant to the conversation.

We also keep in mind that sharing an idea that appeals to a certain
group does not necessarily mean an individual is part of that group or
holds more of that group's views.

#### Race and ethnicity

In most conversations we curate, we identify people by nationality,
rather than race or ethnicity. We should not use these identifications
interchangeably. We should only mention an individual's race or
ethnicity when a conversation is definitively about race.\
\
When we do identify people's race, we should provide a clear explanation
of why it was relevant to do so. When specifying race, we prioritize how
people self-identify and should not generalize or guess about anyone's
race or ethnicity.\
\
We should be wary of coverage that results in a narrow, singular
narrative about diverse groups of people, which can be seen in broad
social issues. This could include the coverage of Black and Hispanic
people in the US, or certain immigrant populations in Europe, or
generalizing reactions by racial or regional classifications, i.e. Asian
women love this new TV series.\
\
In addition to being cautious about word choice, when curating
conversations about race we believe it is also important to be sensitive
to the voices selected, and the communities they represent, the overall
framing, and the choice of images.

#### Immigration status 

Following the lead of [the Associated Press](https://blog.ap.org/announcements/illegal-immigrant-no-more)
and others, we should only use the term "illegal" to describe actions
related to immigration, not to describe people. We avoid using the term
"illegal immigrant" unless it is part of a direct quote, choosing
instead to say someone entered or is living in the country illegally. We
also avoid the term "undocumented."

We should attribute any details about immigration status, for example as
disclosed by a lawyer or the relevant government agency. When possible,
we should also share the person's individual circumstances, such as
whether they overstayed a visa or crossed a border illegally.

The term "migrant" is [generally considered a neutral term](https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-34061097) to
describe a person voluntarily moving from one region or country to
another without implying anything about their legal status.

A refugee usually refers to a person who is forced to leave home to
escape persecution, war or natural disaster.

People who were brought to the US as children should not be described as
having immigrated illegally. When such individuals are listed as having
"temporary resident status," they are typically called "DREAMers,"
referring to the Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors
Act.

We may curate Tweets that do not follow our preferred terms, but we
should exercise caution and keep these guidelines in mind.

#### Impartiality

*"Impartiality is not the same as objectivity or balance or neutrality,
although it contains elements of all three. Nor is it the same as simply
being fair -- although it is unlikely you will be impartial without
being fair-minded. At its simplest, it means not taking sides.
Impartiality is about providing a breadth of view."*
([BBC](https://www.bbc.co.uk/academy/en/articles/art20130702112133788)).

We try to help our readers access the information they need to make an
informed choice about their own opinion. We believe that impartial
curation means not taking sides and taking care to provide the relevant
arguments, facts, and views on any issue without judg~~e~~ment or bias,
and we aim to do so at all times.

To take a page from the [CBC's Journalistic Standards and
Practices](http://www.cbc.radio-canada.ca/en/reporting-to-canadians/acts-and-policies/programming/journalism/),
"on issues of controversy, we ensure that divergent views are reflected
respectfully, taking into account their relevance to the debate and how
widely held these views are."

#### Indigenous populations in Canada, the US, and Australia

Indigenous is the preferred term in Canada and Australia for those whose
roots precede European colonialism. In the US, use Native American, or
in the case of Inuit in Alaska, Alaskan Native. We avoid terms such as
American Indian, Amerindian, and Eskimo.

If an individual or a group identifies as a member of a specific nation,
we may refer to them using that term.

There are three distinct groups of Indigenous peoples in Canada: First
Nations, Métis, and Inuit**.** First Nations is generally used to
describe membership. We avoid describing people as Métis, unless they
explicitly identify as such. The term Inuit refers to any Indigenous
peoples inhabiting the Arctic regions of Greenland, Canada, and Alaska.
The singular version of Inuit is Inuk. For example, "An Inuk man lives
in an Inuit community in northern Canada."

In Australia, Aboriginal refers to clans of first peoples that originate
from mainland Australia (including Tasmania). Torres Strait Islander
refers to the clans that originate from the Torres Strait Islands. We
should refer to both Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders as
Indigenous. We avoid "Aborigine," "Aboriginal" or the abbreviation
"TSI."

In many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities, there are
cultural protocols around using the name, voice, and image of a deceased
person. The family or community will release a statement indicating
whether the deceased can be identified. If the deceased cannot be
identified, we should explain why in the description or an annotation.

#### Islamic State

This group goes by many names, including IS, ISIS, ISIL, and Daesh. We
follow the [BBC's
convention](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-27994277)
of referring to it as "the Islamic State group" or "self-styled Islamic
State" in the first instance and IS for subsequent mentions and titles.

#### LGBTQ

LGBTQ, which stands for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer or
questioning, is our preferred term. We avoid using less common
abbreviations, such as GLTB, but if we must, we should define it. Queer
can be considered a pejorative term, so please use it cautiously.

We should only reference an individual's sexual orientation when it is
essential to understanding the conversation. Nothing in a Moment should
question or devalue a person's gender expression, identity, or sex.

When referring to an individual, use their stated identifiers. If we
don't know their correct pronoun, please use the singular they or them.
We do ~~try~~ not ~~to~~ use quotation marks around names, or pronouns,
used for transgender or non-binary people.

Gay is the preferred term to describe men and women attracted to the
same sex, though lesbian is more commonly used for women. We do not use
gay as a noun.

As the term homosexual is considered pejorative in some markets, we try
not to use it. By the same token, sexual orientation should be used in
place of sexual preference, and LGBTQ people should be described as
"out" rather than "openly gay."

We avoid defamatory terms about the LGBTQ community in any display copy
or selected Tweets unless they are part of a newsworthy direct quote.

##### The transgender community

Transgender persons have a gender identity that differs from the sex
they were assigned at birth. It's an umbrella term that can include
anyone who feels they don't fit into their assigned sex or gender. Drag
queens/kings are not necessarily transgender, though some trans people
are also drag performers.

We should not ~~to~~ use "trans" or "transgender" as a noun. "Trans" is
most often used as an abbreviation for transgender but it can also mean
transsexual, transvestite or other terms with potentially negative
connotations, so it should not be used without a signifier.

We should respect people's gender identities. Thus, we ~~try to~~ refer
to transgender women as women, transgender men as men, people who
identify as non-binary (sometimes "NB" or "enbie") as neither a man nor
a woman. We avoid using "trans man" or "trans woman" (never
"transman"/"transwoman") unless someone self-identifies as such.

We do ~~try~~ not ~~to~~ use quotation marks around names or pronouns.
And we should avoid referring to a person by their "dead"
(pre-transition) name.

People who aren't transgender may be termed as "cis" or "cisgendered."
Some LGBTQ people object to "cis" as an oversimplification, while some
non-transgender people dislike being given a label. We should avoid
"cis" in titles and descriptions, and be mindful of using it carefully
in curated Tweets.

Phrases like "tranny," "she-male," "he-she," "gender-bender", or insults
like "freak", "unnatural" or "fake" are considered offensive, although
advocates may use them to prove a point. We avoid these terms in titles
and descriptions (use "offensive term" or "transphobic term"), but these
terms may be used in curated Tweets if it is essential to the
conversation and the context of their use is clear. We should not
include Tweets that use these terms as direct insults.

We avoid using terms like "transexual", "pre/post-op", "born in the
wrong body" and "sex-change." We generally use "crossdresser"/
"cross-dresses" in place of "transvestite" and "intersex" rather than
"hermaphrodite." We avoid terms that imply someone is "changing their
sex."

Transgender people can have any sexual orientation. We should not assume
a link between their gender and their sexuality.

#### Memes

Memes are images, video or text that rapidly take on a life of their
own, repeating and trending on the platform. Some become icons (Salt
Bae, tea lizard), while others fade quickly into obscurity.

Not everything that is being shared or remixed is [a
meme](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/what-defines-a-meme-1904778/).
We should be seeing a critical mass of repeated use, with a common
thread between the posts, before we label something a meme.

#### Money

When flagging monetary values, we should lead with the currency of the
originating country, for example, British Pounds for Moments occurring
in the United Kingdom. When targeted to other countries, please also
convert the dollar values into USD, which should be indicated as \$X
(US).

#### Names and titles

##### Books, films, shows, and albums

We capitalize the titles of books, films, albums, songs, and TV shows
and do not put them in quotation marks. We reserve double quotes for
lyrics, dialogue, and actual quotes.

We capitalize references to TV seasons, for example, "There were many
dragons in the Season 7 finale." We write the number of the season as a
numeral.

##### Handles

When including a Twitter handle in a description, we should include the
person's real name if it does not match their username.

When describing the people we feature, we avoid calling them \"users.\"
Instead, share their name or the role or detail from their bio that led
to their Tweets being curated. If there isn\'t any biographical
information available, we should use their \@username alone.

Try not to start a Tweet with a \@username. When using a \@username in a
Tweet or sentence, consider the @ symbol silent. For example, instead of
*Player X signs a new contract \@team* it should be *Player X signs a
new contract with the \@team*.

##### Proper names

We respect what people, teams, and organizations call themselves. We do
not remove hyphens or accents. This also applies to names translated
from other languages.

##### Titles

We do not capitalize political titles unless they precede a name. The
Queen is always capped, as is the Pope.

#### Numbers

We write out one through nine, while 10 and above are written as
numerals. Please avoid starting a sentence with a number, except in
titles.

Sports scores are always written in numerals, as are temperatures.

For ages, use the numeral, such as *the girl is 15*, and use hyphens for
ages used as adjectives, i.e. *the 5-year-old boy*.

#### Profanity

We avoid profanity in our titles, descriptions, annotations, and Tweets
from our \@Moments accounts. Tweets used in Moments may contain
profanity, but we prefer to feature Tweets without profanity whenever
possible. Please remember there are cultural differences in regards to
profanity. For example, a common phrase in Australia may be considered
offensive in the US, or vice versa, and therefore should not be included
in curation across markets.

#### Punctuation

##### Brackets and quotation marks

If there is a full sentence inside the parentheses or quote, the
period/full stop should be inside. If only a sentence fragment or
portion of the sentence is inside the brackets, the period should be
outside. For example~~:~~, *We have spelling differences between
markets. (The UK and Canada spell travelled with two Ls.)* versus *There
are punctuation differences between markets (the UK and Canada spell
travelled with two Ls).*

##### Ellipses

We avoid using ellipses. If we do need to use one in a description, for
example when abbreviating a quote, use a space on either side of the
ellipsis.

##### Hyphens

Hyphens (-) are used to connect words such as ages, the 10-year-old boy,
or to modify a term, a 15-point game.

##### Possessives

We default to 's for all singular possessive nouns (Chris's), but follow
[Buzzfeed's
style](https://www.buzzfeed.com/emmyf/buzzfeed-style-guide?utm_term=.ndEjl12aVr#.hx0k1lB8QZ)
on some exceptions:

-   Proper nouns ending in "s" that make a "z" sound

-   Corporations, brand names and proper names that are pluralized

-   Words ending with an "s" sound before a word that begins with an "s"
    > take an apostrophe and an "s" (for appearance\'s sake, but for
    > goodness' sake)

-   Don't use an apostrophe when a word is descriptive rather than
    > possessive (teachers college, writers room)

-   Personal pronouns never take apostrophes (hers, his)

#### Regional differences

We strive to make our Moments as globally accessible as possible. We try
to avoid words in titles and descriptions that have different spellings
or meanings in different markets, i.e. rumor vs. rumour, favorite vs.
favourite. When there isn't an elegant replacement word that can work
across all markets, please default to the style of the country where the
news is happening, e.g. a shopping mall for the US but shopping centre
for the UK.

Tweets from our \@Moments accounts should reflect the spelling for the
associated region. For example, a Tweet that says "favorite" for the US
should be edited to say "favourite" for the UK and Canada.

When referring to regions, please be specific. American can mean either
North American or from the United States, while Britain does not apply
to all of the United Kingdom (which comprises England, Scotland, Wales
and Northern Ireland). By the same token, England and the United Kingdom
cannot be used interchangeably.

Northern Ireland is on the same island as the sovereign state of
Ireland, but is part of the United Kingdom. Ireland is a sovereign state
and not part of the UK. Generally, if someone refers to Ireland they
mean the sovereign state, but in cases where both countries are
referenced and there may be confusion, including Brexit coverage, we can
refer to the independent nation as the Republic of Ireland.

#### Sexual assault and domestic violence

When dealing with allegations of sexual assault and domestic violence,
we prefer to use "survivor" or "alleged victim" rather than "victim" or
"accuser" (unless in direct quotes) to describe people who were
allegedly assaulted. We should not publish the name of the survivor
unless they have come forward publicly.\
\
Use "alleged" to describe circumstances where claims have not been
proven in court.

Please avoid sensationalizing language, such as graphic or invasive
details. For example, name the crime as domestic violence instead of
calling it a "tragedy" or "horror."\
\
We avoid words that can convey judgment, for example, choose "said"
instead of "claimed," "admitted" or "confessed."\
\
We also avoid words that shift blame to the victim and language that
suggests pleasure or consent when curating conversations related to
assault.\
\
For detailed and potentially distressing coverage, use the sensitive
tag, when appropriate.\
\
For further reading, please see [Level Up's guidance on covering domestic violence](https://www.welevelup.org/media-guidelines) and [the Dart Center's guide to reporting on sexual violence](https://dartcenter.org/content/reporting-on-sexual-violence#.UvAJXXdN5mk).

#### Sexual imagery and language

We avoid the use of sexual language, including sexual anatomy, and
gratuitous imagery in our titles, descriptions, and covers.

#### Single-source Moments

We should only curate our own Moment based on a single piece of
reporting or media (such as an article, video or podcast) if it is
generating significant conversation on the platform, and is reflected in
the top trends in the country. This includes profiles of celebrities,
politicians, athletes, and other public figures.\
\
For these Moments, include attribution in the title.

#### Spoilers

While people on Twitter react in real time, we don't want to spoil
anyone's experience watching a show or movie. We avoid giving away major
plot twists in the title, description, cover image or Tweet and should
also include a warning for fans, for example 🚨THIS MOMENT CONTAINS
SPOILERS 🚨.

Please check release dates in other markets before targeting Moments
that could contain spoilers.

#### Sports

We speak to the fans in the language they use. For major sports events
we should provide context, but for other sports coverage we may use team
nicknames and insider terms.

The playoffs do not take a capital, but the Stanley Cup Playoffs as an
event does. The same rule applies to series and games, so we would
capitalize Game 3 and Round 2. We do not capitalize finals unless it's
part of a proper name such as the Western Conference Finals.

Postseason is one word.

##### Soccer/football

Soccer in the US and Canada is football in the UK. We try to write
around this problem by using the name of the league. If it's about MLS
it can default to soccer, whereas if it's occurring in the UK it should
be called football.

#### Suicide and self-harm

[Mental health advocates recommend](https://www.diversitystyleguide.com/glossary/suicide/)
referring to deaths by suicide as \"died by suicide,\" rather than using
terms like \"committed suicide\" or \"victim of suicide.\" The
[American Foundation for Suicide Prevention offers further guidance](https://chapterland.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/13/2018/06/13763_TopTenNotes_Reporting_on_Suicide_Flyer_m1.pdf)
on reporting on suicide.

#### Terrorism

We should not label anything as a terror attack or terrorism until the
country's responsible investigative unit, such as the police or
government, officially declares it as such. In the event of an unclear,
developing breaking news event, please refrain from using "terror" or
"attack" and instead use "incident" or "event."

#### Titles and descriptions

Titles and descriptions should explain the nature and tone of the
conversation, and provide context to make it relevant to a wide
audience. titles and descriptions should be neutral, and if they do
convey a viewpoint, we should state the source of that opinion. Anything
stated in the title and description should also be illustrated in a
Tweet in the Moment.

Questions in titles should be used exceedingly sparingly, and we should
not pose questions that are not fully answered in the Moment.

We write Moments titles in sentence case, not title case, so we only
capitalize the first word of the title and any proper nouns. For
example: *9 best looks from the red carpet,* not *This Baby Seal is
Adorable*. Note that while we avoid starting a sentence with a number in
descriptions, we may do so in titles. Titles should be less than 10
words or 280 characters, while descriptions should generally be about
two sentences.

We do not use periods at the end of titles. We try not to start a title
with "Report,~~:~~" instead use it in a sentence or attribute the
report.

We should not use a comma in a title to replace the word "and." This is
a common newspaper convention, but it detracts from the conversational
nature of our titles and is not commonly used in many markets, including
the UK.

If we use a name or phrase in a title, avoid repeating it in the
description. We should not repeat Tweets, or other Tweet content, in the
title and description.

#### Translations

When translating text, keep the meaning as close as possible to the
original, while also making the translated text easy to read and
understand in the second language. This means it's more important to
keep the sense of the translated text as close as possible to the
original than to have a word-for-word translation.

When sharing translated text in a title, description or annotation,
indicate the original language and that the text has been translated,
for example, *The police officer, speaking in French, said the road
closures would continue through the weekend.*

We may quote translations from trusted government officials, news
agencies and journalists.

We should not include words we do not recognize from foreign languages
in our Moments.

#### Tweet is the word

We always capitalize the mark Tweet, regardless of how it is used.
Retweet is also always capitalized.

We avoid using "Tweetstorm" or "thread" in Moments display copy.

#### Verbs

Nouns and verbs need to agree and use the correct tense. We use informal
but correct language.

We must be consistent in the verb tense used throughout the Moment's
title, description, and Tweets from Moments accounts. Some Moments make
sense to be positioned in the present, e.g. *Beauty bloggers are
painting their cheeks yellow,* while things that are a done deal belong
in the past tense, (e.g. *The team moved on to the conference finals*).

Moments content should be conversational, so we avoid perfect and
progressive verb tenses, e.g., *The prime minister has announced a trip
to China* when we could say: *The prime minister announced a trip to
China*.

#### Weather

A weather watch generally alerts the public to the possibility of
extreme weather, while a warning means it is likely to occur. Please
default to the language used by the national weather service in the
affected region.

##### Temperature

Temperatures get higher or lower, not warmer or cooler. Temperature
figures are written as numerals. When targeting a Moment globally, we
include both Fahrenheit and Celsius.

##### Storms, hurricanes, and typhoons

Storms are assigned a type based on the speed of winds and the location
where they form. Hurricanes form in the North Atlantic Ocean and
Northeast Pacific, while cyclones form over the South Pacific and the
Indian Ocean. Typhoons form over the Northwest Pacific Ocean. Hurricane
categories are based on wind speeds. Those ranked as category three and
above are considered major storms. When calling out wind speeds in a
global Moment, we should provide both kilomet~~r~~es per hour and miles
per hour. For storms in the US and UK, lead with miles, like 160 mph
(260 kph), while global storms should be formatted with kilometres per
hour first, so 260 kph (160 mph).

We capitalize hurricane when it is part of the name forecasters have
given the storm, i.e. Hurricane Irma. We refer to hurricanes as "it"
rather than he or she.

Guidance from the National Weather Service suggests avoiding the term
"weakened" in storm coverage, as it can downplay the perceived threat
from high winds and rain. Once a storm has been downgraded to a tropical
storm or depression, it can be referred to by name or qualified as
remnants, i.e. Residents clean up from Harvey flooding or Cities brace
for remnants of Hurricane Maria.

##### Earthquakes

Earthquakes are registered in magnitude and, according to AP style,
should not include a hyphen, so it's a magnitude 5.9 quake or a 5.9
magnitude quake. Quakes generally need to have a magnitude of 2.5 to 3
to be felt by people, while they begin to cause moderate to severe
damage above 4 or 5. It can sometimes take days before seismologists
have calculated the final magnitude, so we try to hedge early figures
with "preliminary" or "estimated" and cite the reporting agency, for
example: "The USGS estimates the quake had a magnitude of 4.3."
